/**
 * The `uploadFile` function is a JavaScript function that takes in files, valid extensions, folder,
 * and file name as parameters, and returns a promise that resolves with the temporary name of the
 * uploaded file if successful, or rejects with an error message if there is an error.
 * @param files - An object containing information about the file being uploaded. It typically includes
 * properties like `name`, `size`, `type`, and `data`.
 * @param [validExtensions] - An array of valid file extensions. By default, it is set to an empty
 * array, which means all file extensions are allowed.
 * @param [folder] - The `folder` parameter is used to specify the folder where the uploaded file will
 * be stored. By default, it is set to an empty string, which means the file will be stored in the root
 * directory of the "uploads" folder. However, you can provide a folder name to store the file
 * @param [fileName=data] - The `fileName` parameter is a string that represents the desired name of
 * the uploaded file. By default, it is set to "data".
 * @returns The function `uploadFile` returns a Promise.
